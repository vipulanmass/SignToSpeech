# **SignSpeak: Sign Language to Speech Converter**  

## **Overview**  
SignSpeak is an ESP32-based system that translates sign language into speech, providing an accessible communication tool for individuals with speech impairments. The system integrates with a mobile app for customizable command mapping and real-time monitoring of sign inputs via the cloud.  

## **Key Functionalities**  
- **Sign Language to Speech**: Converts sign inputs into corresponding speech output.  
- **Customizable Commands**: Mobile app allows users to define custom phrases for specific sign combinations.  
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Sends and logs sign input data for real-time tracking.  
- **OLED Display Output**: Displays recognized sign inputs for user feedback.  

## **Features**  
- **Real-time Sign Recognition**: Detects and processes sign inputs using limit switches.  
- **Speech Conversion**: Outputs the corresponding speech audio for detected signs.  
- **App Integration**: Users can customize commands and access logs via a mobile application.  
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Stores sign input data in the cloud for monitoring and analysis.  
- **Compact & Portable**: Battery-powered system for on-the-go communication.  

## **Hardware Components**  
- **ESP32 Development Board**: Handles input processing, speech conversion, and cloud communication.  
- **Limit Switches**: Placed on fingers to detect sign combinations.  
- **OLED Display**: Provides real-time feedback on recognized inputs.  
- **Battery & Charge Module**: Ensures portability and continuous operation.

## **Usage**  
1. **User Inputs Sign Language**: The system detects finger positions via limit switches.  
2. **ESP32 Processes the Input**: Converts detected input into a corresponding command.  
3. **Speech Output & Display**: The system plays the corresponding speech and shows the text on the OLED display.  
4. **Cloud Monitoring**: The detected input is sent to the cloud for tracking.  
5. **App Customization**: Users can modify and assign custom speech commands to different sign inputs.
